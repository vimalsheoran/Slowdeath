# Slowdeath
A malicious Python Script to overload hard drives. Pretty dangerous.

#####__Deeper Insight__####

We have been using .bat files to create long list of folders and files to crash the memory but, they can all be detected by mordern day antiviruses. I wrote slowdeath to find a solution to this problem. It is still in testing phase but, it will soon be ready. The catch here is that slowdeath can be used inside startup folders or as autorun files in flash drives. It requires low ram to execute so doesn't panics the system but, over a period of time it will start hearting spreading like cancer. The average user might not know what is wrong. 

ALGORITHM IS ALSO PROVIDED IN ORDER TO CREATE SIMILAR VERSION IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.
